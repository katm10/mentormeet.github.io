            <div>As the media is beginning to acknowledge the reality of the gender gap
              in tech, young women are becoming more empowered to take action and use
              tech to solve world problems. However, there is a challenge of girls not
              being able to find guidance and leadership under someone who has had similar
              experiences. Our solution is an app that matches girls to female mentors
              in STEM who have similar interests and want to help. Users can match up
              with mentors or mentees and direct message them to become closer and find
              ways to talk so that they can learn from one another to become wiser, smarter,
              and more resilient people. Once users have matched with a suitable person,
              users can follow their mentors, mentees, and friends through a social page
              on the app. The app will also promote networking opportunities by displaying
              events and meetups in usersâ€™ areas. This will allow users to see what events
              their friends are attending and follow up on their current projects. By
              creating a strong community of empowered females with similar goals, our
              app will increase the number of women in science-related fields and get
              businesses more involved in this cause.</div>
